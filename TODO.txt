-Use of uninitialized value in array element at .\lib/Game/Term/Game.pm line 207.
hero MUST have a bit of dual life: in UI and in Hero
This has to be limited at minimum, probably in the wasd movement function only setting twice x and y and on_tile.
Also to notice that hero's x and y are set in init game phase taking values from UI hero_x hero_y




resolved: BUG: Use of uninitialized value in print at... sub draw_map appears
ONLY in N and W maps IF exiting no_scroll are from the same side of entrance
AND going then in 90 direction til end
